# Practice Quiz: Conditionals

## 1.What's the value of this Python expression: (2**2) == 4?

    True

## 2.Complete the script by filling in the missing parts. The function receives a name, then returns a greeting based on whether or not that name is "Taylor".

    def greeting(name):
    if name == "Taylor":
        return "Welcome back Taylor!"
    else:
        return "Hello there, " + name

    print(greeting("Taylor"))
    print(greeting("John"))

## 3.Whatâ€™s the output of this code if number equals 10?
```
if number > 11: 
  print(0)
elif number != 10:
  print(1)
elif number >= 20 or number < 12:
  print(2)
else:
  print(3)
```

    2

## 4.Is "A dog" smaller or larger than "A mouse"? Is 9999+8888 smaller or larger than 100*100? Replace the plus sign in the following code to let Python check it for you and then answer.`print("A dog" < "A mouse") print(9999+8888 > 100*100)`

    "A dog" is smaller than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is larger than 100*100


## 5.If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?

    def calculate_storage(filesize):
        block_size = 4096
        # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
        full_blocks = filesize // block_size
        # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
        partial_block_remainder = filesize % block_size
        # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
        # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
        # to store your data.
        if partial_block_remainder > 0:
            return (full_blocks + 1) * block_size 
        return full_blocks * block_size

    print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
    print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096
    print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192
    print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192
