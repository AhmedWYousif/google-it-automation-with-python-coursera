# Practice Quiz: While Loops

## 1.What are while loops in Python?

    While loops let the computer execute a set of instructions while a condition is true.

## 2.Fill in the blanks to make the print_prime_factors function print all the prime factors of a number. A prime factor is a number that is prime and divides another without a remainder.

    def print_prime_factors(number):
    # Start with two, which is the first prime
    factor = 2
    # Keep going until the factor is larger than the number
    while factor <= number:
        # Check if factor is a divisor of number
        if number % factor == 0:
        # If it is, print it and divide the original number
        print(factor)
        number = number / factor
        else:
        # If it's not, increment the factor by one
        factor = factor + 1
    return "Done"

    print_prime_factors(100)
    # Should print 2,2,5,5
    # DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT

## 3.The following code can lead to an infinite loop. Fix the code so that it can finish successfully for all numbers. Note: Try running your function with the number 0 as the input, and see what you get!

    def is_power_of_two(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True

    # Check if the number can be divided by two without a remainder
    while n != 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        n = n / 2
        # If after dividing by two the number is 1, it's a power of two
        if n == 1:
        return True

    return False
    

    print(is_power_of_two(0)) # Should be False
    print(is_power_of_two(1)) # Should be True
    print(is_power_of_two(8)) # Should be True
    print(is_power_of_two(9)) # Should be False
    print(is_power_of_two(64)) # Should be True

## 4.Fill in the empty function so that it returns the sum of all the divisors of a number, without including it. A divisor is a number that divides into another without a remainder.

    def sum_divisors(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1,n):
        if n % i == 0:
        sum = sum + i
    # Return the sum of all divisors of n, not including n
    return sum

    print(sum_divisors(0))
    # 0
    print(sum_divisors(3)) # Should sum of 1
    # 1
    print(sum_divisors(36)) # Should sum of 1+2+3+4+6+9+12+18
    # 55
    print(sum_divisors(102)) # Should be sum of 2+3+6+17+34+51
    # 114
 

## 5.The multiplication_table function prints the results of a number passed to it multiplied by 1 through 5. An additional requirement is that the result is not to exceed 25, which is done with the break statement. Fill in the blanks to complete the function to satisfy these conditions.

    def multiplication_table(number):
        # Initialize the starting point of the multiplication table
        multiplier = 1
        # Only want to loop through 5
        while multiplier <= 5:
            result = number *  multiplier
            # What is the additional condition to exit out of the loop?
            if result > 25 :
                break
            print(str(number) + "x" + str(multiplier) + "=" + str(result))
            # Increment the variable for the loop
            multiplier += 1

    multiplication_table(3) 
    # Should print: 3x1=3 3x2=6 3x3=9 3x4=12 3x5=15

    multiplication_table(5) 
    # Should print: 5x1=5 5x2=10 5x3=15 5x4=20 5x5=25

    multiplication_table(8)	
    # Should print: 8x1=8 8x2=16 8x3=24
