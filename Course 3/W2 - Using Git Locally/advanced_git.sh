# Git Revert Cheat Sheet
git checkout # is effectively used to switch branches.
git reset # basically resets the repo, throwing away some changes.
git commit --amend # is used to make changes to commits after-the-fact, which can be useful for making notes about a given commit.
git revert # makes a new commit which effectively rolls back a previous commit. Itâ€™s a bit like an undo command.
